                            <strong>Batumi</strong> or <em>Batoum,</em> is the second-largest city of Georgia and the capital<br>
                            of the Autonomous Republic of Adjara,<mark>located on the coast of the Black Sea in<br>
                            Georgia's southwest, 20 kilometers north of the border with Turkey.</mark> It is situated<br>
                            in a subtropical zone at the foot of the Caucasus. Much of Batumi's economy revolves<br>
                            around tourism and gambling (it is nicknamed "The Las Vegas of the Black Sea"), but<br>
                            the city is also an important seaport and includes industries like shipbuilding,<br> 
                            food processing and light manufacturing. Since 2010, Batumi has been transformed<br>
                            by the construction of modern high-rise buildings, as well as the restoration of<br>
                            classical 19th-century edifices lining its historic Old Town.[5]<br>

                    <h2>History</h2>
                    <h3>Earli History</h3>
                        <p>Batumi is located on the site of the ancient Greek colony in Colchis called "<em>Bathus</em>" or "<em>Bathys</em>",<br>
                            derived from (Greek: βαθύς λιμεν, bathus limen; or βαθύς λιμήν, bathys limēn; lit. the 'deep harbour').<br>
                            Under Hadrian (c. 117–138 AD), it was converted into a fortified Roman port and later deserted for the <br>
                            <strong>fortress of Petra</strong> founded in the time of Justinian I (c. 527–565). Garrisoned by the Roman-Byzantine forces,<br>
                            it was formally a possession of the <strong>kingdom of Lazica</strong> until being occupied briefly by the <mark>Arabs</mark>, who did not<br>
                            hold it; In 780 Lazica fell to kingdom of Abkhazia via a dynastic union; the latter led the <strong>unification of<br>
                            the Georgian monarchy in the 11th century.</strong><br>
                        </p>
                        <p> From 1010, it was governed by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eristavi">eristavi</a> (ერისთავი, viceroy) of the king of Georgia. In the late 15th century,<br> 
                            after the disintegration of the Georgian kingdom, Batumi passed to the princes (mtavari, მთავარი) of Guria, a<br> 
                            western Georgian principality under the sovereignty of the kings of Imereti.<br>
                        </p>    
                        <p> A curious incident occurred in 1444 when a Burgundian flotilla,<br>
                            after a failed crusade against the Ottoman Empire, penetrated the Black Sea and engaged in piracy along its eastern,<br>
                            coastline until the Burgundians under the knight Geoffroy de Thoisy were ambushed while landing to raid Vaty, as<br> 
                            Europeans then knew Batumi. De Thoisy was taken captive and released through the mediation of the emperor John IV of Trebizond.<br>
                        </p>
                        <h3>Ottoman rule</h3>
                        <p>
                            In the 15th century in the reign of the prince Kakhaber Gurieli, the Ottomans conquered the town and its district but did not hold them.<br>
                            They returned to it in force a century later and inflicted a decisive defeat on the Georgian armies at Sokhoista. Batumi was recaptured by the<br> 
                            Georgians several times, first in 1546 by prince Rostom Gurieli, who lost it soon afterwards, and again in 1609 by Mamia II Gurieli. In 1703, Batumi<br>
                            again became part of the Ottoman Empire. In the one-and-a-half century of Ottoman rule it grew into a provincial port serving the Empire's hinterlands<br>
                            on the eastern fringes of the Black Sea. After the Ottoman conquest, Islamization of the hitherto Christian region began but this was terminated and to<br>
                            a great degree reversed, after the area was annexed to Russian Imperial Georgia after the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–78.<br>
