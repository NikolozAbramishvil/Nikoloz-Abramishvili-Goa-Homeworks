    <h3>Vegetables</h3>
    <p>Certainly! Vegetables offer a wealth of health benefits. Here are some key points:

        Nutrient-Rich: Vegetables are full of essential vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. They provide important health benefits, including:
        Improved Digestive Health: Vegetables are a good source of dietary fiber, which helps pass food through your digestive system and may improve vitamin and mineral absorption.
        Lower Blood Pressure: Green leafy vegetables like kale, spinach, and chard contain potassium, which helps filter sodium out of your body, reducing blood pressure.
        Lower Risk of Heart Disease: Vitamin K in green leafy veggies prevents calcium buildup in arteries, reducing heart disease risk.
        Diabetes Control: High fiber content and a low glycemic index help regulate blood sugar levels.
        Rich in Folate: Essential for red blood cell production and overall health.
        Minerals: Vegetables provide copper, magnesium, zinc, phosphorous, and selenium.
        Nutrients per Serving: The nutritional content varies by vegetable type. For instance, calories range from 6.5 calories per celery stalk to 67 calories per 1/2 cup of peas.
        Recommended Portion Sizes: The USDA suggests adults eat between one and three cups of vegetables daily.</p>
