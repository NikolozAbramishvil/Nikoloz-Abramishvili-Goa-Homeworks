                    Association football, more commonly known as football or soccer,[a] is a team sport 
                    played between two teams of 11 players each, who primarily use their feet to propel
                    a ball around a rectangular field called a pitch. The objective
                    of the game is to score more goals than the opposing team by moving the ball beyond the goal 
                    line into a rectangular-framed goal defended by the opposing team. 
                    Traditionally, the game has been played over two 45-minute halves,
                    for a total match time of 90 minutes. With an estimated 250 million
                    players active in over 200 countries and territories, it is the world's most popular sport.

                    Kicking ball games arose independently multiple times across multiple cultures.[b] The Chinese competitive game cuju (蹴鞠, literally "kick ball"; also known as tsu chu) resembles modern association football.[16]
                    This is the earliest form of a kicking game for which there is scientific evidence, a military manual from the Han dynasty.[17] Cuju players would pass the ball around, again having to avoid it touching the ground at any point.
                    It was then passed to a designated player, who attempted to kick it through the fengliu yan, a circular goal atop 10-11 meter poles.[18] During the Han dynasty (206 BCE – 220 CE), cuju games were standardised and rules were established.[19] Although 
                    Fifa suggests there is no indication of any direct link between Cuju and association football, Cuju and other ancient games demonstrate humanity’s innate predisposition to play with a ball.[20] The Silk Road facilitated the transmission of cuju, especially the game popular
                    in the Tang dynasty, the period when the inflatable ball was invented and replaced the stuffed ball.[21] Other East Asian games included kemari in Japan and chuk-guk in Korea, both influenced by cuju.[22][23] Kemari originated after the year 600 during the Asuka period. It was a ceremonial
                    rather than a competitive game, and involved the kicking of a mari, a ball made of animal skin.[24] In North America, pasuckuakohowog was a ball game played by the Algonquians; it was described as "almost identical to the kind of folk football being played in Europe at the same time, in which
                    the ball was kicked through goals".[25]

                    Association football is one of a family of football codes that emerged from various ball games played worldwide since antiquity. Within the English-speaking world,
                    the sport is now usually called "football" in Great Britain and most of Ulster in the north of Ireland, whereas people usually call it "soccer" in regions and countries
                    where other codes of football are prevalent, such as Australia,[8] Canada, South Africa, most of Ireland (excluding Ulster),[9] and the United States. A notable exception is New
                    Zealand, where in the first two decades of the 21st century, under the influence of international television, "football" has been gaining prevalence, despite the dominance of other codes of 
                    football, namely rugby union and rugby league.[10]

                    The term soccer comes from Oxford "-er" slang, which was prevalent at the University of Oxford in England from about 1875, and is thought to have been borrowed from the slang of Rugby School.
                    Initially spelt assoccer (a shortening of "association"), it was later reduced to the modern spelling.[11][12] This form of slang also gave rise to rugger for rugby football, fiver and tenner 
                    for five pound and ten pound notes, and the now-archaic footer that was also a name for association football.[13] The word soccer arrived at its current form in 1895 and was first recorded in 1889
                    in the earlier form of socca.[14]
